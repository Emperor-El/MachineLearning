# MachineLearning 

Repository to store sample machine learning programs.
 The repository covers a wide range of algorithms and other programs, and would prove immensely helpful for everybody interested in Python programming.
  They are simple to understand and hopefully will prove fun to you.


Contributions to the repository are welcome.
